     <p> I went to the park to take pictures for my photography assignment. I'm really proud such site of attraction was dedicated to Maxwell Ohiorenoya.<br> He was a man of honor and justice. <br><br> The park had beautiful sceneries thought it needs more security because of the Ojota opportunists. It requires maintenance too. But overall i loved it<br> <br> Copyright <b>U</b>2022 My travel Tour</p>
